            <p class="mb-4">
                This project explores a novel approach to diabetes risk assessment by integrating dermatoglyphics (fingerprint patterns) with traditional health metrics. We believe that unique patterns in fingerprints, combined with factors like age, BMI, and family history, can provide a more comprehensive and non-invasive preliminary screening for diabetes risk.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3">Concept</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The core idea is based on the premise that certain physiological conditions, including metabolic disorders like diabetes, might manifest subtle correlations with dermatoglyphic features. While not a definitive diagnostic tool, this application aims to serve as an early warning system or a screening tool that prompts further medical consultation.

            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li>
                    <strong>User Authentication:</strong> Users must first register and log in to access the prediction features, ensuring a personalized and secure experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fingerprint Image Upload:</strong> The user uploads a clear image of their fingerprint.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Our backend (using OpenCV and custom algorithms) processes the uploaded image to automatically extract two key fingerprint features:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5">
                        <li>**Fingerprint Type:** Categorized as Arch, Loop, or Whorl.</li>
                        <li>**Ridge Count:** An estimation of the number of ridges in a specific area.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Additional Health Data Input:</strong> The user then provides other relevant health information, including their Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), and Family History of Diabetes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Diabetes Risk Prediction:</strong> A pre-trained machine learning model (trained on a synthetic dataset combining fingerprint data with health metrics) processes all the collected inputs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Result Display:</strong> The application outputs a prediction of "Low," "Medium," or "High" diabetes risk based on the model's assessment.
                </li>
            </ol>
